Hi!

I'm a PhD student in the College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. My research focus lies at the intersection of quantum sensing and computational imaging in the [Intelligent Imaging and Sensing Lab](https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/ashoka/). The repositories contained herein relate to my undergraduate work, graduate work, and independent explorations.

You can find a more refined presentation of these projects on [my personal webpage](https://nicodeshler.github.io/NicoDeshler/)!
